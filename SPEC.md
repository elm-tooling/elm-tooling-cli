# elm-tooling.json spec

This is the specification for the `elm-tooling.json` file, where unofficial Elm tools can collaborate on per-project configuration they need.

Known support:

| Name                  | `"entrypoints"` | `"tools"` | `node_modules/.bin/` |
| --------------------- | :-------------: | :-------: | :------------------: |
| [elm-language-server] |       ✅        |           |          ✅          |
| [elm-tooling]         |       ✅        |    ✅     |          ✅          |

Note: Anything that supports finding `elm` and `elm-format` in your local `node_modules/.bin/` folder can indirectly use the `"tools"` field via [elm-tooling install].

## File location

`elm-tooling.json` must be located next to an `elm.json` (in the same directory as an `elm.json`).

`elm-tooling.json` contains stuff for the particular Elm project defined by the `elm.json` next to it. There is no “global” `elm-tooling.json` – only project-local ones.

Example:

```
example-project
├── elm-tooling.json
├── elm.json
└── src
   └── Main.elm
```

## Known fields

`elm-tooling.json` must contain a JSON object. All fields are optional for maximum forwards and backwards compatibility as tools need more fields.

Given all known fields, the object must match this TypeScript type:

```ts
type NonEmptyArray<T> = [T, ...T[]];

type ElmTooling = {
  entrypoints?: NonEmptyArray<string>;
  tools?: {
    [name: string]: string;
  };
};
```

Example:

```json
{
  "entrypoints": ["./src/Main.elm"],
  "tools": {
    "elm": "0.19.1",
    "elm-format": "0.8.3"
  }
}
```

The [elm-tooling] CLI tool lets you validate an `elm-tooling.json` file according to all known fields in this spec.

### entrypoints

A list of file paths, to the Elm entrypoint files of the project (the ones with `main =` in them, basically). Compiling all the entrypoints (and the files they import) should produce all compilation errors (if any) of the project.\*

File paths are always relative to the directory containing the `elm-tooling.json` and `elm.json` files.

File paths must start with `./` to make it clear that they are relative.

File paths must use `/` as the directory separator. `\` is not a valid directory separator†. Programs consuming file paths must convert `/` to `\` on Windows if needed.

The array must **not** be empty.

(\*) Excluding tests. For most projects, you should be able to find compilation errors in tests by running `elm-test make`. If tests are located outside `tests/`, though, you would miss out on those. Maybe there should be a `"tests": ["./tests", "./somewhere-else"]` field? Then tools would know to run `elm-test make ./tests ./somewhere-else` to find all test compilation errors. It would also allow elm-test itself to default to `./tests` and `./somewhere-else` when running `elm-test` without arguments.

(†) I think it’s good to avoid the backslash, since it’s used for escaping in JSON.

### tools

A mapping between Elm tool names and the version of the tool.

By specifying versions _once\*_ in _one_ place…

- …you can automatically get the correct elm and elm-format versions, in the terminal and in your editor (whichever editor it is)
- …collaborators on your project can get the correct versions
- …your CI and build pipelines can get the correct versions

(…with the help of tools that read `elm.tooling.json`.)

(\*) For Elm applications, you also need to specify the Elm version in `elm.json`. For Elm packages, you specify a _range_ of compatible Elm versions in `elm.json`. `elm-tooling.json` keeps things simple by always specifying the elm version itself.

For example, the following means that the project uses elm 0.19.1 and elm-format 0.8.3:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "elm": "0.19.1",
    "elm-format": "0.8.3"
  }
}
```

The tools must be located in a standard location: Inside `elm-tooling/` inside “Elm Home.” The Elm compiler stores downloaded packages and REPL history in a directory that I call “Elm Home.” The default location on Linux and macOS is `~/.elm/`, and on Windows it is `%APPDATA%\elm`. You can customize the location by setting the `ELM_HOME` environment variable.

The location of a tool can be resolved like this on Linux and macOS in `sh`, `bash` and `zsh`:

```bash
"${ELM_HOME:-$HOME/.elm}/elm-tooling/$name/$version/$name"
```

With the above example (and assuming that the `ELM_HOME` environment variable is not set) the following two tools should exist on Linux and macOS:

- `~/.elm/elm-tooling/elm/0.19.1/elm`
- `~/.elm/elm-tooling/elm-format/0.8.3/elm-format`

On a typical Windows setup (with a user called “John”), they would be:

- `C:\Users\John\AppData\Roaming\elm\elm-tooling\elm\0.19.1\elm.exe`
- `C:\Users\John\AppData\Roaming\elm\elm-tooling\elm-format\0.8.3\elm-format.exe`

Note that on Windows the `.exe` file extension is used, while on Linux and macOS no file extension is used.

An earlier version of this document stored all tools in the same directory with the version appended to the file name: `~/.elm/elm-tooling/elm0.19.1`. That works, but has the downside of `elm0.19.1` being printed in example commands in `elm --help`. The same issue also occurs with `elm-format`. The nested folder structure also supports tools with several executables per version, such as Elm 0.18 (which has `elm`, `elm-make`, `elm-package`, `elm-reactor` and `elm-repl`).

Consumers of `elm-tooling.json` must use the specified tools and must not use fallbacks if they are missing. Missing tools must be an error, or (if appropriate, and with the user’s permission) cause a download of the tool. Downloads should have security in mind.

If a tool _could_ be specified in the `"tools"` field but isn’t, it is up to the consumer to choose what to do.

Note: Tools, such as elm-test, that require Node.js must be installed with `npm` via package.json and must **not** be specified in the `"tools"` field.

If the `"tools"` field is missing or empty, it means that the project wants to take advantage of other parts of `elm-tooling.json`, but isn’t ready to buy into `elm-tooling.json`’s way of handling tool locations. For example, an existing project might want to use `"entrypoints"` but is fine with continuing to use `npm` to install Elm for the time being.

## How to consume elm-tooling.json

1. Find and read `elm-tooling.json`.\*
2. If not found, abort.
3. Parse the file as JSON.
4. If there’s a JSON parse error, abort.
5. If the result isn’t a JSON object, abort.
6. If the JSON object does not contain the field(s) you need, abort.
7. If the field(s) you need are invalid, abort.
8. Success! Use the data from the field(s) you need.

Any time you abort:

- Treat it as an error if appropriate.
- Log information and use a fallback otherwise. Don’t _silently_ ignore errors in `elm-tooling.json` – users want to know what mistakes they might have made:
  - Not found: The user might have created their `elm-tooling.json` in the wrong place. But it might also mean that the user does not want to use `elm-tooling.json` (if your tool does not mandate it).
  - JSON parse error/Not an object/Invalid fields: Always a mistake by the user.
  - Missing fields: Means that the user has misspelled the field or forgotten to add it, or use `elm-tooling.json` only for some _other_ tool’s sake, not for _your_ tool (if your tool does not mandate it).

It’s recommended to link to the [elm-tooling] CLI tool in error messages/logs or documentation as a tip on how to successfully create a valid `elm-tooling.json` file. The idea is that you could do as much parsing as makes sense for your tool, while the [elm-tooling] CLI could provide as user friendly validation as possible.

(\*) It is up to you to find an `elm-tooling.json` file on disk and read it. The process should be similar to finding an `elm.json` file.

### Example

If you’re looking for entrypoints to a project, you could log one of these lines depending on what you find:

1. “Find entrypoints: No elm-tooling.json found in […]. Defaulting to […]. See https://example.com/docs/entrypoints.html for more information.”
2. “Find entrypoints: /Users/you/code/elm-tooling.json contains invalid JSON: […]. Defaulting to […]. See https://example.com/docs/entrypoints.html for more information.”
3. “Find entrypoints: /Users/you/code/elm-tooling.json does not contain the `entrypoints` field. Defaulting to […]. See https://example.com/docs/entrypoints.html for more information.”
4. “Find entrypoints: /Users/you/code/elm-tooling.json contains an invalid `entrypoints` field: […]. Defaulting to […]. See https://example.com/docs/entrypoints.html for more information.”
5. “Find entrypoints: Using `entrypoints` from /Users/you/code/elm-tooling.json: […]. See https://example.com/docs/entrypoints.html for more information.”

The above logs provide:

- What the task/goal is: “Find entrypoints”.
- What happened.
- What actual value was eventually used (default value, or values from `elm-tooling.json`).
- A link to documentation, explaining the feature in more depth and containing troubleshooting tips.
